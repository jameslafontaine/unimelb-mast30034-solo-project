    "## Personal Checklist for Visualisations and Dashboards:\n",
    "1. Your visualisation needs to tell a story.\n",
    "2. It should be interpretable without being overly verbose.\n",
    "3. The scale and axis need to make sense (and you can assume the reader knows the difference between a normal scale vs log scale).\n",
    "4. The choice of visualisation needs to make sense:\n",
    "    - Line plot vs Bar chart with non-numerical categories\n",
    "    - Map plot with points vs clusters for each location\n",
    "    - Scatterplot vs Histogram plot to see distribution\n",
    "    - etc\n",
    "5. Choice of colour scheme / alpha / size need to be easy on the eyes.\n",
