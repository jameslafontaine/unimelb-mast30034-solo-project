- ensure quirks / limitations of data are being accounted for by carefully consulting data dictionaries
- ensure appropriate comments and docstrings (for functions) are included where necessary, ensure that cells 
  have a clear purpose and are separated appropriately
- could look to also create scripts containing the notebook code to perform preprocessing and download of data 
  to give tutors a more automated and simpler way of obtaining the data and aggregations / sample dataframes
- ensure that each aggregation / sample dataframe is saved as its own parquet to enable easy access and prevent
  memory issues
- if the downloading of external data cannot be automated and the dataset is large, provide instructions and
  screenshots to show tutors how to obtain the data (if small then just upload to git)
- Justify post-COVID timeline selection by noting that taxi and fhv passenger usage may not be the same as it was 
  pre-COVID. In any case it is believed that the most recent data will likely provide the most relevant and up-to-date insights for 
  current Taxi and FHV drivers. The goal of this research is to investigate the several factors which influence a 
  Taxi / FHV driver's income such as where and when they work, who they work for, etc. and to investigate
  the reasons as to why this may be the case where necessary so recommendations can be provided to Taxi and FHV drivers.
  Therefore the target audience of this research is Taxi and FHV drivers who are looking for ways in which
  they can personally maximise their income without simply working more hours.
- For external datasets, use things such as ongoing sports events, protests, weather forecasts (e.g. impact
  of snow), vehicle crashes, raves and music festivals, public holidays (e.g. compare halloween and christmas to regular
  day), etc.
- For visualisation consider boxplots, histograms, bar charts, scatter plots / scatter matrices / bubble plots, parallel coordinates, etc.
  (scatter matrices of features, bar chart of tip amount or earnings by day, week, month, etc. with taxi and different fhvs side by side)
- Could conduct further studies on other for hire services (traditional livery, luxury and black cars)
- Clean up download.ipynb by making function for data download and csv to parquet conversion potentially, reorganise to reduce duplicate code (use variables for repeated directory names etc.)
- Clean up preprocessing.ipynb by making function for fixing malformed dataframe schema and potentially making directiories as well
